    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Beans: </strong>Place the soaked beans and Waakye
        leaves in a large pot. Cover with water and boil for 20-30 minutes until
        the beans are partially tender. The water will turn a deep red.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Add the Rice: </strong>Remove and discard the Waakye leaves. Add the washed rice and salt to the pot. Add just enough hot water to cover the mixture by about 1.5 cm (1/2 inch).</li>
      <li><strong>Steam: </strong>Bring to a quick boil, then immediately reduce heat to the absolute lowest setting. Cover the pot with a tight lid and let it steam for 20-25 minutes. <strong>It is crucial that you do not stir it.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Rest & Serve: </strong>Turn off the heat and let the Waakye rest, still covered, for 10 minutes. Fluff gently with a fork and serve hot with your favourite sides.</li>
