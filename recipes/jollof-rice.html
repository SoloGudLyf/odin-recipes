    <h2>Classic Ghana Jollof Rice</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe guides you through creating a vibrant and deeply flavourful
      Jollof Rice, a beloved staple across West Africa. The key is to build a
      rich, aromatic tomato and pepper base before slowly steaming the rice to
      perfection.

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Create the Pepper Purée:</strong>
        <br />
        In a blender, combine the 6 tomatoes, one of the large onions (roughly
        chopped), the garlic cloves, and the chillies (if using). Blend until
        you have a smooth, consistent purée. Set this aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sear the Protein: </strong> <br />
        Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over
        medium-high heat. If using raw meat or chicken, season it lightly with
        salt and pepper. Add the protein to the hot oil and sear on all sides
        until nicely browned. Remove the protein with a slotted spoon and set it
        aside, leaving the flavourful oil in the pot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Build the Flavour Base: </strong>Dice the second large onion.
        Reduce the heat to medium, add the diced onion to the pot and sauté for
        5-7 minutes until softened and translucent. Add the tomato paste and
        cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring constantly. This step caramelises
        the paste, deepening the flavour and giving the Jollof its signature
        rich red colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer the Sauce: </strong> Pour the blended tomato purée into
        the pot. Add your stock (or water and stock cubes), the ground white and
        black pepper, dried thyme, and the bay leaf. Stir everything together
        well. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a steady simmer. Cover
        and cook for about 10-15 minutes to allow the flavours to meld together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Season Generously: </strong>Uncover the sauce and taste it. At
        this stage, it needs to be seasoned boldly with salt. The rice will
        absorb a significant amount of salt and flavour, so the sauce should
        taste slightly more seasoned than you think is necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the Rice: </strong>Rinse your long-grain parboiled rice
        under cool water until the water runs clear. Add the rinsed rice to the
        simmering sauce and stir thoroughly to ensure every grain is coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Steam to Perfection: </strong>Reduce the heat to the absolute
        lowest setting. Cover the pot tightly with a lid. For an even better
        seal, you can place a layer of aluminium foil over the pot before
        putting the lid on. Let it steam, undisturbed, for 20-25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Final Mix: </strong>Uncover the pot. The rice should have
        absorbed most of the liquid. Add your seared protein (or mixed
        vegetables) back into the pot. Gently fluff and fold the rice with a
        fork to combine. If the rice seems too dry, you can add up to 1 cup of
        hot water or stock.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Finish Cooking: </strong>Replace the foil and lid and allow it
        to steam for a final 10-15 minutes, or until the rice is tender and
        fluffy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rest and Serve: </strong>Turn off the heat and let the Jollof
        rice stand, covered, for at least 5-10 minutes. This lets the grains
        settle and absorbs the last bit of steam. Before serving, fluff one last
        time with a fork. It is delicious served on its own or with a side of
        fried plantain and a simple salad.
