    <h2>How to Make Authentic Ghanaian Fufu</h2>
    <p>
      Fufu is a soft, stretchy, dough-like swallow, fundamental to Ghanaian
      cuisine. It is not eaten by itself, but serves as the perfect, hearty
      accompaniment to rich and flavourful soups. The authentic version is made
      by pounding boiled cassava and green plantain, a rhythmic process that
      creates a uniquely smooth and tender result. For convenience, a powdered
      version is also widely used.

    <p>
      This method requires strength and rhythm, and is often a two-person job.
      The result is unparalleled in texture and taste.

    <h3>Ingredients & Equipment:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium-sized Cassava Root</li>
      <li>2 semi-ripe Green Plantains</li>
      <li>Water for boiling</li>
      <li>A pinch of salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Essential Equipment:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A large, heavy Mortar (called Waduro)</li>
      <li>A heavy wooden Pestle (called Woma)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Peel and Prepare:</strong> Using a sharp, sturdy knife, peel the
        thick brown skin off the cassava and the green skin off the plantains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chop: </strong>Cut the cassava and plantain into small, roughly
        2-inch chunks. Be sure to remove the tough, stringy core from the center
        of the cassava.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Boil:</strong> Place the chunks in a large pot. Add the pinch of
        salt and cover generously with water. Bring to a boil and cook for about
        20-25 minutes, or until the cassava and plantain are very soft and can
        be easily pierced with a fork.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Prepare for Pounding:</strong> Drain all the hot water from the
        pot, but you may reserve a small bowl of it for later.
      </li>
      <li>Pound the Fufu:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Place the boiled plantain into the mortar first. The plantain is
          softer and creates a good base. Begin pounding it into a smooth,
          sticky paste.
        </li>
        <li>Once the plantain is smooth, add the cassava chunks in batches.</li>
        <li>
          Pound with firm, rhythmic strokes. Traditionally, a second person sits
          by the mortar, turning the dough with their hand between strikes,
          using the reserved hot water to keep their fingers from sticking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Safety Note: If you are pounding alone, pound at a slower pace. Stop
          periodically to use the pestle or your wetted hand to fold and turn
          the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Continue pounding until all lumps are gone and you have a smooth,
          soft, and elastic dough.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Shape and Serve: </strong>Wet your hands and shape the fufu into
        smooth, round portions. Place in a serving bowl and serve immediately
        with hot soup.
      </li>
    </ol>
