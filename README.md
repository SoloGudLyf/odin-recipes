## Project Description
This is a simple HTML project and is about food recipes. In this project I've carefully selected popular and great ghanaian dishes, talked about them briefly, included their ingredients and actionable steps in their preparation as well.

## Self-reflection
This project has provided an opportunity for me to demonstrate my newly discovered HTML powers, I got to use and see certain HTML elements in action, elements like headers, strong, lists, links, image e.t.c I also tried my best to write structured commits and committed early and often
